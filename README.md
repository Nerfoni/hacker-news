# Hacker News

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project was made as a part of an job review assignment in a day. It also acted as an experiment to try out new techniques and libraries I hadn't used before such as [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) UI components and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The home page displays top stories from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and utilizes server side rendering. New stories are fetched using continuous scrolling and Next.js server actions.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
# or
yarn i
# or
pnpm i
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
